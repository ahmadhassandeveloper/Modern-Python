Internet ban to continue until vandals are caught: Rana Sanaullah

Interior Minister Rana Sanaullah says the internet ban will continue until all the instigators and perpetrators who burnt down houses have been arrested.

Speaking to Geo News, the PML-N leader said he would have to seek the prime minister’s guidance over the issue if the matters involving Imran Khan extended beyond May 17.

“There are many people who used these services legally and they are the ones losing out so we have to keep that under surveillance,” Sanaullah added.

“The situation is that the people who have come out, their entire work is done on the internet, all their abuse, their planning, all of it is done on social media.”
5/12/23, 5:30 PM - +92 300 8263374: We should be prepared for the long run.
5/12/23, 5:37 PM - +92 300 8263374: [5:29 pm, 12/05/2023] +92 305 4426364: Assalamualaikum sir, my assignment portfolio website

Name: Muhammad Hamail
I created my portfolio website three months ago.
https://myportfolionext-three.vercel.app/
I also created the full stack ecommerce website "https://mhmarket.pk" for my brother. He is seller on daraz.pk.
I don't think so i am a good developer but i created many front-end pages, full stack sites and components for practice.
Now I am working on this project, 'https://mycomponent.vercel.app/', in my spare time. My purpose is to create my own best UI component to reuse and save my time on future projects.
